Mall Customer Clustering App
Overview
This project is a Python-based application that uses clustering algorithms to segment mall customers based on their shopping behavior. It includes scripts for model training and development of a Streamlit app, allowing users to explore customer segments.

The application provides insights into customer groups to help businesses make data-driven decisions, such as personalized marketing and resource optimization.

Features
Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
User-friendly Streamlit application that allows customers to input their data and see which group they belong to.
Visualizations of clusters and customer behavior.
Models built with data from the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset.
Scripts
Mall Customer Clustering Models.py

This script trains multiple clustering models, including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, on mall customer data.
It generates clusters based on features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
Key visualizations (e.g., elbow plots, dendrograms) are included for model evaluation and cluster analysis.
Clustering_app.py

This is the Streamlit app script that allows users to interact with the trained clustering model.
The app takes customer input (such as age, income, and spending habits) and outputs the cluster they belong to.
Built using Streamlit for a simple and interactive user experience.
Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mall-customer-clustering-app.git
cd mall-customer-clustering-app
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed. Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include libraries like:

plaintext
Copy code
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
seaborn
streamlit
3. Run the Clustering App
After installing the dependencies, run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run Clustering_app.py
The app will open in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Run the Application: Open the app and input customer data, such as age, income, and spending score.
View Results: The app will classify the customer into a predefined cluster based on the input.
Analyze Clusters: For in-depth analysis, use the Mall Customer Clustering Models.py script to retrain models or tweak hyperparameters.
Visualizations
Some of the visualizations generated include:

Elbow Method: Used to find the optimal number of clusters.
Dendrogram: For hierarchical clustering.
Cluster Visualizations: Showing customer segments based on key features (e.g., Age vs. Income, Income vs. Spending Score).
Technologies Used
Python: For model development and application logic.
scikit-learn: For clustering algorithms and data processing.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
Streamlit: For building the interactive customer clustering app.
Dataset
The project uses the Mall Customer Segmentation Data from Kaggle, which contains the following fields:

CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): Customer's spending score assigned by the mall.
Future Work
Improved Customer Insights: Add more features or behavioral data for better segmentation.
Deploy the App: Deploy the app on platforms like Heroku or AWS to make it accessible online.
Recommendation Engine: Integrate personalized recommendations for each customer cluster.
